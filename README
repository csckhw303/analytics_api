Then:
“npm install” (installs all node modules necessary to run application)

If there is any libraries that are imported but not installed, use “npm install [library name]”

The below commands are for api.py:
“Pip install mysql connector-python”

RUNNING CODE:
For the front-end portion:
Go into the analytics folder

For the api:
python3 api.py

OVERVIEW OF CODE:
An brief summary of the flow of the code:
React Calls action in redux to grab data
Action calls function that calls api (which handles a response when sending a specific url)
Api.py determines what data to retrieve from the database based on url 
Returns data to action, create object (with type and payload/data)
Dispatch that object to reducers, go thru every reducer and check for matching type of reducer
Reducer: connects and matches the data retrieved from database to the global state/variable
Reducer returns object to the store (place for global states)
In react page, mapStateToProp maps local variable inside of props (component property) to the global state in store 
Then display that prop variable on web page
